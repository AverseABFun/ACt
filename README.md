### Another Disease tracker

ADt is a work-in-progress app to allow predictions of sickness and locations of so-called "disease hotspots". This is planned to be part of the [Congressional App Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/), and is designed to motivate efforts around tracking and preventing disease, as well as locating possible places where people are getting sick from.
