### Another COVID-19 tracker

ACt is a work-in-progress novel Coronavirus(COVID-19, caused by SARS‑CoV‑2) tracker that will include onboard ML systems to PREDICT exposure. Note that any ML system creates predictions, which are just that and should NOT be taken to mean that you definitely have COVID, and merely mean you should take a COVID test soon. ACt's ML systems will also only be released once they have been trained for a while, as they will be extremely inept at prediction for quite a while. The source code will be stored in this repositiory, and once a full instance of the backend is going it will NOT be public. This is solely because, while no personal data will be kept, it still includes pretty precise location data, time, and test result.
