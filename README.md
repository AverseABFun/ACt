# ADt
### Another Disease tracker

ADt is a work-in-progress app to aggregate disease data and track disease. You will also be able to submit data manually to it. This is planned to be part of the [Congressional App Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/), and is designed to motivate efforts around tracking and preventing disease, as well as locating possible places where people are getting sick from.
